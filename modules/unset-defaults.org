Emacs has some default behaviors that are generally annoying. Let's disable them!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "yes"
  ;; Turn off all unnecessary GUI elements.
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)

  ;; Unless something is actively exploding, I do not care.
  (setq warning-minimum-level :emergency)

  ;; customize is the worst.
  (setq custom-file "/dev/null")
  (setq package-selected-packages "/dev/null/")

  ;; These keybinds suspend Emacs (in order to mimic terminal behavior).
  ;; This has *only* caused me trouble in GUI Emacs.
  (when (display-graphic-p)
    (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))
    (global-unset-key (kbd "C-x C-z")))

  ;; Stop making backup files everywhere, put them all in one place!
  (setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . "~/.saves")))
  (setq backup-by-copying t)

  ;; Stop Emacs from bothering you about disabled commands.
  (setq disabled-command-function nil)

  ;; Prevent any attempts to resize the frame.
  (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

  ;; Stop Emacs from trying to use dialog boxes.
  (setq use-dialog-box nil)

  ;; Prefer y/n over yes/no.
  (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

  ;; Mouse behavior tweaks? TODO look into me
  (setq mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(1 ((shift) . 1) ((control) . nil)))
  (setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed nil)

  ;; Visual line mode is just better.
  (global-visual-line-mode)
