#+TITLE: .emacs.d - revamped!

* About
My personal (and opinionated) Emacs configuration with emphasis on functionality and visuals.
Note: *running Emacs with this configuration could potentially modify important files and install packages on your system*. It likely won't, but don't blindly run it. If you're interested, reading through and copying sections of [[./config.org][config.org]] is likely the best way to do things.
